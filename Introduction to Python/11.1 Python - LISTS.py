"""
LIST
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and
Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

"""

thislist1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print('thislist1 = ', thislist1)

"""
List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
"""

thislist2 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print('thislist2 = ', thislist2)

"""
List Length
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
"""

thislist3 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print('thislist3 = ', thislist3)
print('len(thislist3) = ', len(thislist3))

"""
List Items - Data Types
List items can be of any data type:
"""
print('\nList items can be of any data type : ')
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

print('list1 = ', list1)
print('list2 = ', list2)
print('list3 = ', list3)

"""
A list can contain different data types:
"""
print('\nlist can contain different data types : ')
list4 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

print('list4 = ', list4)

"""
The list() Constructor
It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
"""
print('\nThe list() Constructor :')
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets
print('list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) = ', thislist)

"""
Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.

Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.

Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.


*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, 
dictionaries are unordered.

"""

"""
Access Items
List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:

Note: The first item has index 0.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])
print(thislist[0])

"""
Negative Indexing
Negative indexing means start from the end

-1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
"""

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])
print(thislist[-2])

"""
Range of Indexes
You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.

Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
"""

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])

""""
By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])

"""
By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:])

"""
Range of Negative Indexes
Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
"""

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])

"""
Check if Item Exists
To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")

"""
Python - Change List Items
Change Item Value
To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)

"""
Change a Range of Item Values
To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, 
and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:

"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)

"""
If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted 
where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)

"""
Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted 
does not match the number of items replaced.

If you insert less items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where 
you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist)

"""
Insert Items
To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can 
use the insert() method.

The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
Note: As a result of the example below, the list will now contain 4 items.

"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)

"""
Python - Add List Items

Append Items
To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)

"""
Insert Items
To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.

The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)

"""
Extend List
To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.

The elements will be added to the end of the list.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tropical = ["mango", "pineapple", "papaya"]
thislist.extend(tropical)
print(thislist)

"""
Add Any Iterable
The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any 
iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thistuple = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thistuple)
print(thislist)

"""
Python - Remove List Items

Remove Specified Item
The remove() method removes the specified item.

"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print('thislist.remove("banana") :', thislist)

"""
Remove Specified Index
The pop() method removes the specified index.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop(1)
print(thislist)

"""
If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop()
print(thislist)

"""
The del keyword also removes the specified index:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)

"""
The del keyword can also delete the list completely.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist
# print(thislist) # this will cause an error because you have succsesfully deleted "thislist"

"""
Clear the List
The clear() method empties the list.

The list still remains, but it has no content.
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.clear()
print(thislist)

"""
Python - Loop Lists
Loop Through a List
You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
"""
print('\nYou can loop through the list items by using a for loop :')
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
    print(x)

"""
Loop Through the Index Numbers
You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

The iterable created in the example below is [0, 1, 2].
"""
print('\nloop through the list items by referring to their index number :')
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(i, thislist[i])

"""
Using a While Loop
You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.

Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your 
way through the list items by refering to their indexes.

Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.

"""
print('\nloop through the list items by using a while loop :')
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
    print(thislist[i])
    i = i + 1

"""
Looping Using List Comprehension
List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:
"""
print('\nList Comprehension offers the shortest syntax -   [print(x) for x in thislist]  :')
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]

"""
Python - List Comprehension

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new 
list based on the values of an existing list.

Example:
Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
    if "a" in x:
        newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

"""
With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)

"""
The Syntax
newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

Condition
The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.
"""
# Only accept items that are not "apple":
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]

"""
The condition is optional and can be omitted:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits]
print(newlist)

"""
Iterable
The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc.

You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
"""
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]
print(newlist)

newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]
print(newlist)

"""
Expression
The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can 
manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]
print(newlist)

"""
You can set the outcome to whatever you like:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]
print(newlist)

"""
The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome:
"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
print(newlist)

"""
Python - Sort Lists
Sort List Alphanumerically
List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:

Sort the list alphabetically:
"""
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)

"""
Sort the list numerically:
"""
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)

"""
Sort Descending
To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True:
"""
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse=True)
print(thislist)

"""
Customize Sort Function
You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.

The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first):
"""


def myfunc(n):
    return abs(n - 50)


thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key=myfunc)
print(thislist)

"""
Case Insensitive Sort
By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all 
capital letters being sorted before lower case letters:
"""
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)

"""
Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list.

So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function:
"""
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key=str.lower)
print(thislist)

"""
Reverse Order
What if you want to reverse the order of a list, regardless of the alphabet?

The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.
"""
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.reverse()
print(thislist)

"""
Python - Copy Lists

Copy a List
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes 
made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

"""
Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)

"""
Python - Join Lists
Join Two Lists
There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.

One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.
"""
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)

"""
Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one:
"""
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
    list1.append(x)

print(list1)

"""
Or you can use the extend() method, which purpose is to add elements from one list to another list:
"""
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
