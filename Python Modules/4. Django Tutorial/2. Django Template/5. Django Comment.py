Django comment Tag

Comments
Comments allows you to have sections of code that should be ignored.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome Everyone</h1>
{% comment %}
  <h1>Welcome ladies and gentlemen</h1>
{% endcomment %}

</body>
</html>


Comment Description
You can add a message to your comment, to help you remember why you wrote the comment, or as message to other people
reading the code.

# Add a description to you comment:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome Everyone</h1>
{% comment "this was the original welcome message" %}
    <h1>Welcome ladies and gentlemen</h1>
{% endcomment %}

</body>
</html>


Smaller Comments
You can also use the {# ... #} tags when commenting out code, which can be easier when for smaller comments:

# Comment out the word Everyone:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome{# Everyone#}</h1>

</body>
</html>

Comment in Views
Views are written in Python, and Python comments are written with the # character:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome Everyone</h1>

</body>
</html>


# Comment out a section in the view:
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader

def testing(request):
  template = loader.get_template('template.html')
  #context = {
  # 'var1': 'John',
  #}
  return HttpResponse(template.render())
