Pandas Read CSV

Read CSV Files
A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated files).

CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.

In our examples we will be using a CSV file called 'data.csv'.

Tip: use to_string() to print the entire DataFrame.
"""
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print('Load the CSV into a DataFrame :')
print(df.to_string())

"""
If you have a large DataFrame with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows:
"""
df2 = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print('\nOutput without to_string() :')
print(df2)

"""
max_rows
The number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.

You can check your system's maximum rows with the pd.options.display.max_rows statement.
"""
print(pd.options.display.max_rows)

"""
In my system the number is 60, which means that if the DataFrame contains more than 60 rows, the print(df) statement 
will return only the headers and the first and last 5 rows.

You can change the maximum rows number with the same statement.
"""
pd.options.display.max_rows = 9999

df3 = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print('\nNow display max_rows set to 9999 :')
print(df3)
